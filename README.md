# Stroke-Prediction
This is my first implemented Data Science project. I am currently pursuring my bachelors in Statistics (as of June 24, 2022) and am really excited to really put full effort into my career. This project uses multiple methods to create a machine learning model with high accuracy, precision, and recall to try and determine whether or not a given patient has had a stroke. This can also be used for someone who has not had a stroke, if they want to see if they are living a healthy lifestyle.


# Inspiration
Many members of my family have suffered from stroke or stroke-like instances in my lifetime, providing reasoning that it may be a genetic predisposition. That got me thinking about what I could do to try and minimize the risk of getting one myself. Through this project I found the most likely causes of a stroke and how those attributes contribute to the formation of a Stroke.
